Release: 20141115

BSP430 is a set of C language adaptation layers simplifying cross-MCU
library and application development on Texas Instruments MSP430
microcontrollers.

The target audience is experienced embedded systems developers who need full
control over the microcontroller but are willing to trade a small amount of
performance for improved component re-usability and rapid prototyping.

BSP430 features:

* A configuration infrastructure allowing you to include only those
  resources and capabilities required by your application;

* A set of abstraction layers enabling efficient identification and
  manipulation of peripheral capabilities at both register and functional
  levels;

* A callbacks callback infrastructure allowing unrelated capabilities to
  share resources including port and timer interrupt handlers;

* A platform model that enables rapid development on common hardware
  solutions including six TI experimenter boards as well as custom boards;

* Integrated support for watchdog and low power mode execution

* A build infrastructure designed to simplify creating new applications
  in a POSIX command-line environment supported by GNU Make, with GNU C
  (legacy `MSPGCC`_ and upstream msp430-elf) and TI compiler toolchain
  support
