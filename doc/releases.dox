\section releases_20141114 Changes in Release 20141114

@li Completed support for @link msp430elf GNU msp430-elf
toolchain@endlink including use of newlib.
@li Added a facility for @link msp430elf_ld_far far ROM support@endlink.
@li Added support for <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/msp-exp430fr4133">MSP-EXP430FR4133</a>
@li Rework and extension of sensor interfaces
@li Added an @link bsp430/utility/event.h event notification@endlink
infrastructure
@li Enhancements to NTP support
@li Add @link uiBSP430uptimeScaleForDisplay utility to display
human-readable durations@endlink

\section releases_20140602 Changes in Release 20140602

@li Integrated support for the upstream GNU msp430-elf toolchain.
Select by defining @c WITH_GCC_MSP430_ELF=1 when building.
@li @c examples/Makefile.common moved to @c make/Makefile.common.  It is
not specific to examples, and should be made available for general use.
@li lBSP430uptimeSleepUntil() renamed to eliminate suffix @c _ni as this
function will now disable interrupts and restore the calling interrupt
state as necessary to do its work.
@li ulBSP430uptimeConversionFrequency_Hz() renamed to eliminate
suffix @c _ni as this function will now disable interrupts and restore
the calling interrupt state as necessary to do its work.
@li Refactor the sensor interfaces so code can be shared among
applications.
@li Refactor the CC3000 support, using a separate Makefile.cc3000 to
access the host driver, and adding features like firmware upgrade
support, smart config support, and NTP.
@li More Sharp Memory LCD support (wider variety of displays).
@li Change default I2C bus on EXP430F5529LP to free SPI for CC3000.

\section releases_20140310 Changes in Release 20140310

@li Fix LPM5 locking on FR58xx devices (not reported as an issue, bad me)
@li Support #BSP430_PLATFORM_BOOSTERPACK_SHARP96 and similar Sharp
Memory LCD displays with a demo and in @ref bsp430/utility/u8glib.h.
@li Add demo of <a
href="http://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-55618/l/element14-fuel-tank-boosterpack-for-ti-launchpad">BOOSTXL-BATTPACK</a>,
which turns out to be useless because it drains in three days with no load
connected.
@li Validate and document the current state of @ref ex_rf_cc3000 which
is IMO pretty cool.

\section releases_20140301 Changes in Release 20140301

@li Support for #BSP430_PLATFORM_EXP430F5529LP
@li Support for #BSP430_PLATFORM_EXP430FR5969
@li Update @ref bsp430/utility/u8glib.h to upstream 1.15
@li Update @ref ex_platform_exp430f5529_fatfs to support 0.10 and 0.10a
@li Add CC3000BOOST boosterpack support to @ref ex_rf_cc3000
@li Add #configBSP430_RFEM_CCEM RFEM boosterpack support
@li Example of ADXL335 on Fraunchpad
@li CC3000 Service Pack 1.11 enhancements

\section releases_20130625 Changes in Release 20130625

\subsection releases_20130625_nirh Replacement of _ni with _rh

In this release many functions with @link enh_interrupts_ni _ni@endlink
suffixes were renamed to use the @link enh_interrupts_rh _rh@endlink
suffix, allowing them to be used when interrupts are disabled if
resource conflicts are prevented through some other mechanism such as
@ref bsp430/resource.h.  Existing code may be translated using the sed
script at <tt>${BSP430_ROOT}/maintainer/nirh_serial.sed</tt>, with the
following command line (assuming your sources are under git):

@verbatim
git ls-tree HEAD \
  -r -z --name-only \
| xargs -0 sed -i -r -f ${BSP430_ROOT}/maintainer/nirh_serial.sed
@endverbatim
