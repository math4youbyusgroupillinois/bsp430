/** @file
 *
 * @brief A generic console output capability.
 *
 * This module collects various functions that format and generate
 * human-readable output on a serial console, or support reading data
 * from a serial console.
 *
 * @section h_utility_console_interrupts Interrupts and Console Operations
 *
 * In the original design of BSP430 console output was performed with
 * interrupts disabled under the belief that the potential of
 * interleaved output between different tasks and interrupts was
 * undesired.  In practice, interrupt handlers only invoke console
 * output when debugging, and this can be handled other ways.  The
 * impact of extended periods with interrupts disabled was
 * unacceptable in applications that require prompt response to
 * interrupts, such as radio packet reception and acknowledgement
 * transmission.
 *
 * Consequently all console output and input are now non-blocking and
 * disable interrupts only where this is necessary to prevent
 * corruption when both interrupt handlers and user code manipulate
 * the same data structures.
 *
 * The script <tt>${BSP430_ROOT}/maintainer/xni_console.sed</tt> may
 * be used to convert older sources to the new API where @link
 * suffix_ni <tt>_ni</tt>@endlink suffixes are no longer present.
 *
 * @section h_utility_console_capabilities Basic Capabilities
 *
 * Core routines natively supported are cputchar(), cputs(), and
 * cgetchar().  Extensions include cputchars(), cputtext(), and
 * cpeekchar().
 *
 * With library support through #BSP430_CONSOLE_USE_EMBTEXTF or <a
 * href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mspgcc/files/msp430-libc/">msp430-libc</a>
 * in the MSPGCC toolchain full support for formatted output via
 * cprintf() and vcprintf() is possible.
 *
 * In addition optimized routines are provided to convert integers in
 * standard bases with minimal space overhead (cputi(), cputu(),
 * cputl(), cputul()).  The integer routines are more cumbersome but
 * necessary when the platform cannot accommodate the stack overhead
 * of cprintf() (on the order of 100 bytes if 64-bit integer support
 * is included).
 *
 * Compile-time options #BSP430_CONSOLE_RX_BUFFER_SIZE and
 * #BSP430_CONSOLE_TX_BUFFER_SIZE enable interrupt-driven input and
 * output, allowing the application to make progress while output is
 * produced and input buffered using interrupts.
