/** @file

 * @brief Standardized interface for GPS sensors
 *
 * This header declares functions that should be implemented for
 * specific GPS sensors, such as the @link bsp430/sensors/skytraq.h
 * SkyTraq Venus 638FLPx@endlink, to provide access to NMEA messages
 * and a one-pulse-per-second (1PPS) capability.  See @ref
 * ex_sensors_venus6pps for an example application.
 *
 * The API also includes some functions implemented in a generic
 * module to assist with decoding NMEA sentences and converting
 * between GPS and UTC time bases.  BSP430 re-uses the time
 * representation of POSIX @c time_t and <tt>struct tm</tt>, and may
 * assume availability of functions in the POSIX @c <time.h> header.
 *
 * The intent is that generic GPS capability is implemented in
 * accordance with this header, but specific devices may provide
 * enhanced capabilities in device-specific headers.
 *
 * @note Much of this module was created to leverage the 1PPS and
 * time-keeping capabilities of the GPS system to provide clock data
 * for a wireless sensor network.  There are references to leap
 * seconds, POSIX time encodings, UTC and GPS time systems, and POSIX
 * and GPS epochs.  The documentation assumes the reader is familiar
 * with these concepts.  If you are not, see
 * http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/gps and
 * http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/unix-leap-seconds.html among
 * <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=gps+time">other references</a>.

/** Prototype for applications that receive GPS messages from the infrastructure.

 * The GPS sensor will generally receive messages over a serial
 * connection.  When a message is successfully received, it will
 * invoke a function conforming to this prototype that was provided to
 * it by iBSP430gpsInitialize() so that the application can process
 * the message.
 *
 * This function is invoked within a hard-interrupt context, so the
 * provided data should be recorded and the function should return as
 * quickly as possible.  Ownership of the memory associated with the
 * message is transferred to the callee, which must in turn invoke
 * vBSP430gpsReleaseMessage_ni() to release it when the message is no
 * longer needed.  It is permitted to invoke
 * vBSP430gpsReleaseMessage_ni() within this callback if the
 * application does not need the message.
 *
 * The @p msg pointer will be null if the driver started to receive a
 * message but either discovered it to be corrupt or did not have
 * sufficient memory to store it.
 *
 * There is no notification related to messages that were dropped
 * because they were corrupted.
 *
 * The return value is incorporated into the caller's ISR return
 * value, so the application can request a wake-up from LPM if the
 * message requires processing.
 *
 * @param msg A pointer to the start of the received message (null if
 * the message could not be stored).  The message body will be a
 * NUL-terminated NMEA sentence (excluding start-of-sentence and
 * checksum) or a binary packet depending on the underlying sensor's
 * configuration.  There is no alignment promise on binary messages.
 *
 * @param len The number of octets within the message.  For NMEA text
 * messages the length includes the terminating NUL added by the
 * driver.
 *
 * @param rx_utt The ulBSP430uptime() value when the start-of-sentence
 * character for @p msg was received.
