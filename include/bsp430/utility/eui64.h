 * @brief Support for EUI-64 retrieval.
 *
 * An Extended Unique Identifier in 64-bits (EUI-64) is a 64-bit value
 * intended to uniquely identify a device.  In some cases uniqueness
 * may be restricted to instances of a given device type.  These
 * values are commonly used for interface identifiers in IPv6 and
 * other situations where it is necessary to distinguish between nodes
 * in a system.
 *
 * @note The EUI-64 guidelines specify two distinct null values: all
 * bits zero and all bits 1.  BSP430 standard practice is to denote
 * the all-zero version as a @link BSP430_EUI64_IS_NULL null@endlink
 * EUI-64 which no data has yet been surveyed, and the all-ones
 * version as @link BSP430_EUI64_IS_INVALID invalid@endlink to denote
 * inability to obtain EUI-64 information.  Thus, a null-initialized
 * object containing a #uBSP430eui64 object is cleared and ready for
 * assignment, perhaps to an invalid value.
