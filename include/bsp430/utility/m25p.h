 * @brief Support for M25P-compatible serial SPI flash memory devices.
 *
 * Micron/Numonyx serial SPI flash devices such as the M25P16 and
 * M25PE20 are commonly used on MSP430-based wireless sensor
 * platforms.  This module defines the command and status constants
 * for the M25P interface; a structure holding the required SPI, CS#,
 * and RESET# information to interact with the device, and
 * declarations for module functions that encode and transmit
 * commands.
 *
 * The module also supports #configBSP430_PLATFORM_M25P and
 * #BSP430_PLATFORM_M25P to allow applications to request access to a
 * platform-supplied flash memory chip without encoding platform
 * dependencies in the source code.
 *
 * As with other parts of BSP430, this is a low-level interface that
 * does not provide convenience wrappers for functions like erasing a
 * sector or chip, or reading and writing the device contents.  It
 * does provide enough to allow the application to do this, including
 * the ability to initiate a read or write operation and complete it
 * using programmed I/O (iBSP430m25pCompleteTxRx_rh()),
 * interrupt-driven SPI transactions, or DMA, based on the
 * application's needs.
 *
 * @note The commands constants defined in this module (e.g.,
 * #BSP430_M25P_CMD_PW) cover all known M25P implementations.  Not all
 * commands are supported on all devices.
 *
 * @ref ex_utility_m25p shows how to use this interface.
