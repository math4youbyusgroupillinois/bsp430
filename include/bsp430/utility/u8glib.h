/** @file
 *
 * @brief Declarations related to platform-specific u8glib support
 *
 * <a href="http://code.google.com/p/u8glib/">Universal Graphics
 * Library for 8 Bit Embedded Systems</a> is portable library with
 * text and graphical support for LCDs commonly used on
 * microcontroller platforms.
 *
 * u8glib is highly influenced by Arduino, and adding another target
 * platform to the library itself would be messy; however, it's fairly
 * easy to create bridge support in each platform to provide the
 * interface from hardware to the library.  This module defines the
 * shared material related to the BSP430-provided interfaces.
 *
 * The majority of the peripheral resource identifiers and constants
 * are platform-specific;
 * e.g. #BSP430_PLATFORM_TRXEB_LCD_SPI_PERIPH_HANDLE.  The interface
 * for u8glib does not required that these be abstracted and made
 * available generically.
 *
 * Access to the platform-specific interface requires adding @c
 * u8g_bsp430.c to the set of source files compiled into the program,
 * along with the necessary pieces of u8glib itself including any
 * desired fonts.  Also include <tt>\$(PLATFORM_U8G_PB_C)</tt> which is
 * defined in the platform-specific @c Makefile.common to select the
 * correct low-level implementation based on the display orientation
 * and color support.
 *
 * @see @ref ex_utility_u8glib
