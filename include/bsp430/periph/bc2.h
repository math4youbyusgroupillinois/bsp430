 * @brief Hardware presentation/abstraction for Basic Clock Module+ (BC2).
 *
 * The BC2 ("Basic Clock Module+") peripheral is present in 2xx-family
 * devices.
 *
 * @section h_periph_bc2_opt Module Configuration Options
 *
 * @li #configBSP430_BC2_TRIM_TO_MCLK
 *
 * @section h_periph_bc2_hpl Hardware Presentation Layer
 *
 * As there can be only one instance of BC2 on any MCU, there is no
 * structure supporting a BC2 HPL.  Manipulate the peripheral through its
 * registers directly.
 *
 * @section h_periph_bc2_hal Hardware Adaptation Layer
 *
 * As there can be only one instance of BC2 on any MCU, there is no
 * structure supporting a BC2 HAL.
 *
 * The standard set of capabilities in the bsp430/clocks.h header are
 * supported, with the following details:
 *
 * @li For ulBSP430clockConfigureMCLK_ni() the only recognized
 * frequencies are 1 MHz, 8 MHz, 12 MHz, and 16 MHz.  Availability of
# * a given frequency depends on the specific MCU having
 * factory-calibrated constants supporting that frequency.  The
 * selected frequency may be above or below the requested frequency,
 * but will be the closest supported by available calibrated clocks.
 *
 * @li Dependent on #configBSP430_BC2_TRIM_TO_MCLK the requested
 * frequency may be reached through calibration process executed
 * during ulBSP430clockConfigureMCLK_ni().
 *
 * @li The implementation assumes that MCLK and SMCLK are both
 * sourced from DCOCLK.

 *
 * nThe BC2 peripheral supports only a small number of calibrated DCO
 * clock frequencies, and it is not uncommon for them to be off by a
 * significant amount for the cheaper ValueLine MCUs.  If an ACLK
 * source at a trusted rate is available, the MCU can implement a loop
 * to converge on a DCO configuration that supports a specific

 *
 * @warning The accuracy of the resulting frequency is proportional to
 * the accuracy of the returned value of #ulBSP430clockACLK_Hz_ni().
 * If ACLK derives from VLOCLK, that estimate may be off by several
 * percent, which will generally result in serial errors if SMCLK is
 * used to generate a baud rate clock.  You may wish to check
