 * @brief Hardware presentation/abstraction for flash memory peripheral (FLASH).
 *
 * A flash memory peripherals is available on almost every MSP430 MCU,
 * and may be identified as either FLASH or FLASH2.  Different MCUs in
 * the same family are one or the other.  The differences between
 * these peripherals are visible in the interface provided by this
 * module.
 *
 * @section h_periph_flash_opt Module Configuration Options
 *
 * None supported.
 *
 * @section h_periph_flash_hpl Hardware Presentation Layer
 *
 * As there can be only one instance of the flash memory peripheral on
 * any MCU, there is no structure supporting a FLASH @HPL.  Manipulate
 * the peripheral through its registers directly.
 *
 * @section h_periph_flash_hal Hardware Adaptation Layer
 *
 * As there can be only one instance of FLASH on any MCU, there is no
 * structure supporting a FLASH @HAL.
