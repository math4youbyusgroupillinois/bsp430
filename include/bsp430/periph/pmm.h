/** @file

 * @brief Hardware presentation/abstraction for Power Management Module (PMM).
 *
 * The Power Management Module is present on 5xx/6xx/FR5xx devices,
 * and has differences in FRAM devices that are not reflected by this
 * interface.
 *
 * @section h_periph_pmm_opt Module Configuration Options
 *
 * None supported.
 *
 * @section h_periph_pmm_hpl Hardware Presentation Layer
 *
 * As there can be only one instance of PMM on any MCU, there is no
 * structure supporting a PMM @HPL.  Manipulate the peripheral through its
 * registers directly.
 *
 * @section h_periph_pmm_hal Hardware Adaptation Layer
 *
 * As there can be only one instance of PMM on any MCU, there is no
 * structure supporting a PMM @HAL.
 *
 * Inline functions defined in this module support forcing processor
 * resets that include a complete reset of all registers and
 * peripherals.

 * The Supply Voltage Supervisor and Monitor High- and Low-Side
 * Control registers affect the time required for waking from low

 * on timing and power consumption is in the MCU-specific data sheet.
 *
 * To disable the supervisor and monitor without changing any other

 * use:
 *
 * @code
 * #if (BSP430_PMM_SUPPORTS_SVSM - 0)
 * BSP430_PMM_SET_SVSMCTL_NI(SVSMHCTL & ~(SVMHE | SVSHE), SVSMLCTL & ~(SVMLE | SVSLE));
 * #endif // BSP430_PMM_SUPPORTS_SVSM
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param hctl_ The new value for #SVSMHCTL, e.g. <tt>#SVSMHCTL & ~(#SVMHE | #SVSHE)</tt>
 * @param lctl_ The new value for #SVSMLCTL, e.g. <tt>#SVSMLCTL & ~(#SVMLE | #SVSLE)</tt>
 *
 * @warning Changing any other flags, but particularly the core
 * voltage, may requires care to wait for stability before making
 * changes.  See iBSP430pmmSetCoreVoltageLevel_ni() and the peripheral
 * documentation, errata, and application notes.
 *
 * @par For wake-up
 *
 * Each data sheet will specify @a t_WAKE-UP-FAST (~5 us MSP430F5438A)
 * and @a t_WAKE-UP-SLOW (~150 us MSP430F5438A), which are the time to
 * move from LPM2, LPM3, or LPM4 to active mode (MCLK running).  In
 * the power-on configuration @a t_WAKE-UP-SLOW will be on by default,
 * resulting in significant delays in interrupt handling, as
 * demonstrated by @c examples/platform/timer_lpm.  Only #SVSMLCTL
 * affects wakeup time.
 *
 * @par For power consumption
 *
 * Enabling the SVS increases power consumption (200 nA for
 * MSP430F5438A).  In full-performance mode the cost is higher (1.5 uA
 * for MSP430F5438A).  The cost is listed in the data sheet in the
 * separately for each of high and low cross supervisory and
 * monitoring functions.  Initial experimentation suggests that
 * disabling all four capabilities reduces current by only 3uA in
 * LPM3, though more may be reduced when active.
