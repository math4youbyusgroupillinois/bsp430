/** @file
 *
 * @brief Hardware presentation/abstraction for FLL Plus (FLLPLUS).
 *
 * The FLLPLUS and FLLPLUS_SMALL peripherals are present in 4xx-family
 * devices.
 *
 * FLLPLUS_SMALL differs from FLLPLUS in lack of support for XT2 and
 * for SELM/SELS.  The difference is not reflected in this
 * implementation.
 *
 * @section h_periph_fllplus_opt Module Configuration Options
 *
 * None supported.
 *
 * @section h_periph_fllplus_hpl Hardware Presentation Layer
 *
 * As there can be only one instance of FLLPLUS on any MCU, there is no
 * structure supporting a FLLPLUS @HPL.  Manipulate the peripheral through its
 * registers directly.
 *
 * @section h_periph_fllplus_hal Hardware Adaptation Layer
 *
 * As there can be only one instance of FLLPLUS on any MCU, there is no
 * structure supporting a FLLPLUS @HAL.
 *
 * The standard set of capabilities in the bsp430/clocks.h header are
 * supported, with the following details:
 *
 * @li The peripheral requires LFXT1 be available and running at a
 * stable #BSP430_CLOCK_NOMINAL_XT1CLK_HZ.  The value for that crystal
 * rate defaults to 32 KiHz.
 *
 * @li This peripheral does not support dividing SMCLK.  Attempts to
 * configure an alternative divisor will result in a zero divisor.

 * @li The implementation does not support configuring ACLK to
 * anything other than #eBSP430clockSRC_XT1CLK or a fallback from that
 * clock.  (The issue is that not all chips with FLLPLUS support
 * selecting the #eBSP430clockSRC_VLOCLK.)
