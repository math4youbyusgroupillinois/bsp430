/** @file
 *
 * @brief Hardware presentation/abstraction for SYS peripheral (SYS).
 *
 * The System Control Module (SYS) is present on 5xx/6xx/FR5xx
 * devices.
 *
 * @section h_periph_sys_opt Module Configuration Options
 *
 * None supported.
 *
 * @section h_periph_sys_hpl Hardware Presentation Layer
 *
 * As there can be only one instance of SYS on any MCU, there is no
 * structure supporting a SYS @HPL.  Manipulate the peripheral through its
 * registers directly.
 *
 * @section h_periph_sys_hal Hardware Adaptation Layer
 *
 * As there can be only one instance of SYS on any MCU, there is no
 * structure supporting a SYS @HAL.
 *
 * The functions provided by this module simplify the extraction of
 * reset causes, notification of type of reset, and translation from
 * MCU-specific reset codes to text cause descriptions.
