 * @brief Hardware presentation/abstraction for Unified Clock System (UCS).
 *
 * The Unified Clock System (UCS) is present in 5xx/6xx-family
 * devices.  A variant UCS_RF differs from UCS by adding support for
 * XT2.  This difference is currently ignored.
 *
 * @section h_periph_ucs_opt Module Configuration Options
 *
 * @li #configBSP430_UCS_TRIM_DCOCLKDIV enables specific MCLK
 * frequencies to be configured
 *
 * @section h_periph_ucs_hpl Hardware Presentation Layer
 *
 * As there can be only one instance of UCS on any MCU, there is no
 * structure supporting a UCS @HPL.  Manipulate the peripheral through its
 * registers directly.
 *
 * @section h_periph_ucs_hal Hardware Adaptation Layer
 *
 * As there can be only one instance of UCS on any MCU, there is no
 * structure supporting a UCS @HAL.
 *
 * The standard set of capabilities in the bsp430/clocks.h header are
 * supported, with the following details:
 *
 * @li Comparison of SMCLK against a clock of known frequency is
 * required to set MCLK frequencies as there are no DCO calibration
 * constants for this peripheral.  bsp430/platform/bsp430_config.h
 * will automatically request the required #configBSP430_TIMER_CCACLK
 * in support of this unless #configBSP430_UCS_TRIM_DCOCLKDIV is
 * explicitly disabled.
 *
 * @li FLLREFDIV is /1.
 *
 * @li MCLK and SMCLK are sourced from DCOCLKDIV
 *
 * @li DCOCLKDIV is DCOCLK/2 (the power-up value)
 *
 * @li FLL trimming will leave the FLL disabled if it was disabled on
 * entry; see #configBSP430_CORE_DISABLE_FLL.
 *
 * @li Executing an FLL trim (either directly or due to having invoked
 * ulBSP430clockConfigureMCLK_ni()) will record in private state
 * the measured clock frequency.
 *
 * @li ulBSP430clockMCLK_Hz_ni() and ulBSP430clockSMCLK_Hz_ni() return
 * values are calculated by applying the relevant clock dividers as
 * read from the UCS registers to the recorded measured clock
 * frequency.

 * ulBSP430clockConfigureMCLK_ni().
 *
 * The function is expected to be used periodically to maintain an

 * temperature, and other factors such as chip errata that introduce
 * clock drift.  The implementation is not entitled to reconfigure to
 * a different DCO range selection, should that be supported by the
 * clock.  Consequently, oscillator faults may result if the system
 * drifts so far that the target frequency cannot be represented
 * within the current range.  In such a situation,
 * ulBSP430clockConfigureMCLK_ni() should be re-invoked to configure
 * the clock.
 *
 * Trimming is done relative to XT1CLK (if available) or REFOCLK
 * (otherwise).

 * and ACLK.  Any peripherals that depend on those clocks should be
 * disabled while the function is executing.
