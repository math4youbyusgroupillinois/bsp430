/** Constant to specify no peripheral in preprocessor checks.
 *
 * Where a functional resource may be specified by either an
 * application or a platform, we need a way to identify it that
 * permits preprocessor checks that default the corresponding core
 * resource capability.  The peripheral handle values such as
 * #BSP430_PERIPH_TB0 cannot be used for this, since their expansion
 * includes cast operations that cannot be used in preprocessor
 * expressions.  Consequently there is a parallel integral-valued C
 * pre-processor identifier for each MCU peripheral.
 *
 * For example, if #BSP430_UPTIME_TIMER_PERIPH_CPPID is defined to
 * #BSP430_PERIPH_CPPID_TB0, then the following code ensures that
 * #configBSP430_HAL_TB0 and #configBSP430_HAL_TB0_ISR are both
 * defined to 1.
 *
 * @code
 * #if BSP430_UPTIME_TIMER_PERIPH_CPPID == BSP430_PERIPH_CPPID_TB0
 * #define configBSP430_HAL_TB0 1
 * #define configBSP430_HAL_TB0_ISR 1
 * #endif // BSP430_UPTIME_TIMER_PERIPH_CPPID
 * @endcode
 *
 * See <bsp430/periph/want_.h> for an infrastructure that uses these
 * constants to enable features without complex preprocessor
 * manipulation within user code.
 *
 * The value for #BSP430_PERIPH_CPPID_NONE indicates that no core
 * resource is associated with the functional resource.
