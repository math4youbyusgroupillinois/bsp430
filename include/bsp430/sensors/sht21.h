 * @brief Interface to the <a
 * href="http://www.sensirion.com/en/products/humidity-temperature/humidity-sensor-sht21/">Sensirion
 * SHT21 Digital Humidity Sensor</a> or the <a
 * href="http://www.meas-spec.com/product/humidity/HTU21D.aspx">Measurement
 * Specialties HTU21D</a> clone.
 *
 * This device measures relative humidity and temperature.
 *
 * To use this with BSP430 you will need an I2C device.  See @c
 * examples/sensors/bmp085 for an example of how to use it.
 *
 * @note For all operations that involve I2C, the caller must hold the
 * @p i2c resource.  For most functions the following conditions apply
 * at the time the function is invoked:
 *
 * @note @li @p i2c may be in @link iBSP430serialSetReset_rh reset
 * mode @endlink on entry, in which case it will be put back into
 * reset mode before returning.  @p i2c must @b not be in @link
 * iBSP430serialSetHold_rh hold mode @endlink.
 *
 * @note @li The slave address of the @p i2c resource will be
 * reconfigured as a side effect of calling the function.
 *
 * @note When @p hold_master is used in
 * iBSP430sensorsSHT21initiateMeasurement() the I2C bus is not
 * restored to reset mode on return.  The caller must do so, after
 * successful completion of iBSP430sensorsSHT21getMeasurement(), if
 * desired.
