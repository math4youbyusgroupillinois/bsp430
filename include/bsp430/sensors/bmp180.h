 * <a
 * href="https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/en/homepage/products_3/environmental_sensors_1/bmp085_1/bmp085">BMP085</a>.
 *
 * This device measures absolute atmospheric pressure and temperature.
 *
 * To use this with BSP430 you will need an I2C device.  See @c
 * examples/sensors/bmp085 for an example of how to use it.
 *
 * @note For all operations that involve I2C, the following conditions
 * apply at the time the function is invoked:
 *
 * @note @li The caller must hold the @p i2c resource
 *
 * @note @li @p i2c may be in @link iBSP430serialSetReset_rh reset
 * mode @endlink on entry, in which case it will be put back into
 * reset mode before returning.  @p i2c must @b not be in @link
 * iBSP430serialSetHold_rh hold mode @endlink.
 *
 * @note @li The slave address of the @p i2c resource will be
 * reconfigured as a side effect of calling the function.
