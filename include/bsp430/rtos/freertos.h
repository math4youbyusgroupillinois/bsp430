/** @file
 * @brief BSP430 interface to FreeRTOS
 *
 * More specifically, to the <a
 * href="http://github.com/pabigot/freertos-mspgcc">BSP430-enabled
 * FreeRTOS port supporting MSPGCC</a>.  Other toolchains aren't
 * intentionally excluded, they just aren't supported yet.
 *
 * This header is not included by any BSP430 code, nor should it be
 * directly included by application code.  It is included by the
 * freertos-mspgcc port of FreeRTOS via the @c portmacro.h header if
 * #configBSP430_RTOS_FREERTOS is defined to a true value by the
 * compilation environment.  Doing this makes basic BSP430
 * configuration data available within FreeRTOS application code.
 * Note that this inclusion occurs before FreeRTOS.h includes the
 * application-specific FreeRTOSConfig.h, allowing this file to set
 * defaults for the FreeRTOS port.
 *
 * The @c FreeRTOS.h header is similarly included by @c
 * bsp430/core.h when #configBSP430_RTOS_FREERTOS is defined to a
 * true value by the compilation environment.  This ensures that the
 * BSP430 infrastructure uses FreeRTOS-compatible mechanisms for
 * critical sections and interrupt management.

 * "FreeRTOS.h", making available the standard FreeRTOS environment to
 * BSP430 library code and defining RTOS-related macros to use the
 * FreeRTOS implementation.
 *
 * <li> Cause the inclusion of "FreeRTOS.h" to include
 * <bsp430/core.h>, make standard BSP430 configuration data
