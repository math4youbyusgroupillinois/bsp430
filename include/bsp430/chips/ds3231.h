/** @file
 * @brief Chip data for Maxim DS3231 I2C RTC/TCXO/Crystal
 *
 * This file contains the register map for the DS3231 real-time clock
 * chip.  There is no abstraction for the functional capability of the
 * chip, except that there are routines to convert between the
 * register map and POSIX standard time structures.
 *
 * To incorporate the conversion routines add the following to your @c Makefile:
@verbatim
VPATH += $(BSP430_ROOT)/chips
MODULES += chips/ds3231
@endverbatim
