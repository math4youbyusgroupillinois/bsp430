 * @brief Declarations for abstracted serial interface.
 *
 * The MSP430 line has a variety of peripherals that support serial
 * communications, including the origin 2xx/4xx family USCI, 5xx USCI,
 * and 5xx eUSCI.  These are sufficiently similar in function that it
 * is useful to have a hardware abstraction layer that delegates to
 * the peripherals available on the current platform.

 * peripheral-specific analog) is set, clearing all errors and
 * stopping all activity but retaining all configuration information.
 * Interrupts are disabled.  When the hold is released the #UCSWRST
 * bit is cleared, and any interrupts for which callbacks are
 * registered are re-enabled.  (Note that enabling the interrupts at
 * the peripheral level does not change the #GIE state, which should
 * be cleared while this function is executing.)
 *
 * When the peripheral is in I2C mode, any pending #UCTXNACK,
 * #UCTXSTP, #UCTXSTT, or similar family-specific requests will be
 * cleared before the reset is released.
 *
 * Placing a serial peripheral into reset mode prior to entering a low
 * power mode will often reduce current consumption.  Entering and
 * leaving reset mode is also the simplest way to clear peripheral
 * errors and flush pending data.
 *
 * @note A positive value for @a resetp places the peripheral into
 * reset mode immediately.  This can result in data loss if
 * transmitted data is still in progress.  Passing a negative value
 * for @a resetp does the functional equivalent of invoking
 * vBSP430serialFlush_ni() prior to placing the device in reset.
 *
 * @warning The GPIO configuration of peripheral pins is not affected
 * by this function.  Power consumption in a low power mode may be
 * elevated as a result.  Consider using iBSP430seriaLSetHold_rh().
 *
 * @note This function differs from iBSP430serialSetHold_rh() in that
 * it:
 * @li Allows caller to determine whether to wait for pending activity
 * to complete before placing the peripheral in reset mode.
 * @li Does not reconfigure port pins; these remain in their
